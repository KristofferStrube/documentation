To do so, log into slack and go to the [OAuth Tokens](https://api.slack.com/docs/oauth-test-tokens) page.![OAuth Tokens Page](/images/apps/slack/generate_token.png)Click the *Create token* button and copy the generated token (colored in red and prefixed with `xoxp-`).## Install the Slack App on elmah.ioLog into elmah.io and go to the log settings.

In the Channel, input the name of the Slack channel you want messages from elmah.io to show up.

When new errors are logged, messages start appearing in the channel that you configured.Finally, if you need more control on what to log and/or your want to customize the messages, you should read our guide on [Integrating elmah.io with Slack manually](http://docs.elmah.io/integrate-elmah-io-with-slack/).
