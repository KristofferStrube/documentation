# Missing server side information on uptime errorsTo decorate uptime errors with server side error information, you will need a few things:1. The monitored website should be configured to log errors to elmah.io.
2. The uptime check needs to be created on the same log as the monitored website.
3. The uptime error needs to be logged after October 2017.
4. The BotBuster app must not be installed. When installed, errors generated by Uptime Monitoring are ignored (since Uptime Monitoring is in fact a bot).
