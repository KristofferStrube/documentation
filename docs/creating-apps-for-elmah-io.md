# Creating Apps for elmah.ioDeveloping custom apps for elmah.io is possible through a bit of JSON and NuGet magic. This document show you how.Apps on elmah.io are basically a nice wrapper around the Business Rule Engine on elmah.io. Using business rules, users can execute various actions based on Lucene queries against logged messages. Ignore messages based on a specific user agent, call the Slack API when fatal messages are logged are just a few examples on the possibilities using rules.For this example we'll create a small app posting requests to RequestBin on every error. Probably not the most usable app, but serves the example well. RequestBin works by creating a bin, which you can then create HTTP requests against. Each bin contains a unique ID, which we will use in a second.## Creating manifest.jsonTo start creating the app, create a new file named `manifest.json`:```js{	"variables": [{		"key": "bin",		"name": "Bin",		"description": "The Id of the bin to post to",		"example": "1k5c4qb2",		"type": "text",		"required": true	}],	"rule": {		"title": "Post a message to RequestBin on all messages",		"query": "severity: Error",		"then": {			"type": "http",			"url": "http://requestb.in/$bin",			"method": "post",			"contentType": "application/json",			"body": "{\"timestamp\": \"$time\", \"message\": \"$message\", \"severity\": \"$severity\"}"		}	}}```The manifest consists of two blocks: `variables` and `rule`. Variables serves as input for generating the UI when users add the app to their log on elmah.io. In variables you can ask the user for information needed in order to execute the rule like username and password, access tokens or as in this example, an id of a bin on RequestBin.For now, only `text` variables are available, but we may extend this with other types like `bool`, `number` etc.The `rule` section tell elmah.io what this app should do. The two important fields to notice here is `query` and `then`. These terms match 1:1 to the same terms in the business rules. `query` should contain either a full-text query string or a Lucene query. Every message logged, matching this query, triggers the `then` part of this app. For the simple app, we query messages based on `severity` and `userAgent`. For a complete list of search fields, visit the Rules tab on your log settings.In the `then` section we tell elmah.io what to do with messages matching the `query`. In this case, we want it to create a new HTTP request on http://requestb.in. Notice how the `$bin` variables from before is used as part of the URL. `body` contains examples on built-in variables like `$message` and `$time`. Built-in variables are documented on the Rules tab of the log settings as well.A final note about `then`. In this example we use the `"type": "http"` to allow elmah.io to make HTTP requests. Types corresponding to other actions available in the rule engine are available as well. These are `ignore`, `hide` and `email`.## Creating a NuSpecApps for elmah.io are distributed as NuGet packages. There's a few requirements you will need to satisfy in order for your app to show up in the elmah.io UI.Let's write a NuSpec for our app named `elmah.io.apps.requestbin.nuspec`:```xml<?xml version="1.0"?><package xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/packaging/2010/07/nuspec.xsd">  <metadata>    <version>1.0.0</version>    <authors>elmah.io</authors>    <owners>elmah.io</owners>    <id>elmah.io.apps.requestbin</id>    <title>RequestBin Integration</title>    <requireLicenseAcceptance>false</requireLicenseAcceptance>    <description>Post a new HTTP request to RequestBin when messages are logged in elmah.io.</description>    <projectUrl>https://github.com/elmahio/elmah.io.apps.requestbin</projectUrl>    <iconUrl>https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5c4cb3646528821117abde6d2d5ee22d?s=32</iconUrl>	<tags>Error Exception Reporing Management Logging ELMAH Diagnostics Tracing RequestBin</tags>  </metadata>  <files>    <file src="manifest.json" target="manifest.json" />  </files></package>```The configuration is pretty simple. We include a single file (`manifest.json`) in the root of the package and name the package with `elmah.io.apps.` prefix. In fact this is a requirement for the package to work.## Building and Publishing the AppTo build the app, we use `nuget.exe`:```powershellc:\projects\elmah.io.apps.requestbin>nuget packAttempting to build package from 'elmah.io.apps.requestbin.nuspec'.Successfully created package 'c:\projects\elmah.io.apps.requestbin\elmah.io.apps.requestbin.1.0.0.nupkg'.```To upload the package to NuGet, use `nuget push`:```powershellc:\projects\elmah.io.apps.requestbin>nuget push elmah.io.apps.requestbin.1.0.0.nupkg MyApiKeyPushing elmah.io.apps.requestbin 1.0.0 to the NuGet gallery (https://www.nuget.org)...Your package was pushed.```(replace `MyApiKey` with your API Key located on nuget.org)That's it folks. The app is now public and available in elmah.io.## Testing the PackageTo test that everything is working, we'll start by creating a new bin on RequestBin. Go to [http://requestb.in/](http://requestb.in/) and click the *Create a RequestBin* button:![Bin Created](/images/create_requestbin.png)In this case, the bin ID is `1chhlvo1`.Log into elmah.io and go to the Apps tab on the log settings. The RequestBin app is available from the list of apps in the bottom. Click the *Install* button:![RequestBin Settings](/images/requestbin_settings.png)Observe how the `bin` variable from `manifest.json` shows up in the log settings with the `description` and `example` as we specified.Input the bin ID and click the *Save* button.To test that everything is working, you can use elmah.io's API to publish a new message to your log, which should match the query specified in `manifest.json`:```powershellcurl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"title": "Manual error", "severity": "Error"}' https://elmah.io/api/v2/messages?logId=MyLogId```(replace `MyLogId` with your log ID)Refresh the bin at RequestBin and observe the HTTP request performed by the app:![HTTP request in RequestBin](/images/requestbin_message.png)Isn't that just the most awesome thing you have seen all day? The JSON format specified in `manifest.json` now ends up on RequestBin using a homebrewed elmah.io app.To see more examples of elmah.io apps, check out [elmah.io.apps.slack](https://github.com/elmahio/elmah.io.apps.slack), [elmah.io.apps.hipchat](https://github.com/elmahio/elmah.io.apps.hipchat) and [elmah.io.apps.github](https://github.com/elmahio/elmah.io.apps.github) all available on GitHub.
