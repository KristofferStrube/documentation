# Handle elmah.io downtimeLike every other SaaS product out there, we cannot promise you 100 % uptime on elmah.io. We understand, that your logging data is extremely important for your business and we do everything in our power to secure that elmah.io is running smoothly. In fact we normally have an average of [99.9 % uptime](http://status.elmah.io/1105484) on our API.But how do you handle that remaining 0.01 % of the time where you need to log a message in elmah.io and the service is down? You have a few options actually:1. You can subscribe an event handler to listen for this situation (where communicating with the elmah.io API fails). To hook up an event handler, write this piece of code in your initialization code:```csharpElmah.ErrorLog.GetDefault(null); // Forces creation of logger clientvar logger = ErrorLog.Client;logger.OnMessageFail += (sender, args) =>{    var message = args.Message;    var exception = args.Error;    // TODO: log message and/or exception somewhere else.}```2. If you want to be able to rollback to another solution, in case elmah.io goes down, you can actually log to multiple error logs as described here: [Logging to multiple ELMAH logs](logging-to-multiple-elmah-logs).We constantly work to improve the uptime of the entire solution.
