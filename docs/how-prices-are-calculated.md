# How prices are calculated

When using elmah.io, you may experience the need to switch plan, update your credit card and other tasks which will require changes to your current payment. Every time you change something that requires a new or upcoming charge on your credit card, we reset your subscription. This means that we charge you the difference from what you already paid, to the cost of what you are switching to.

**Example 1: Switch to a higher plan**

If you purchased a Small Business ($29) on June 1 and want to upgrade to Business ($49) on June 15, we charge you ~ $35. You already paid $15 for half of June on the Small Business plan, why the remaining amount is deducted from the $49. Your next payment will be on July 15.

**Example 2: Switch to a lower plan**

If you purchased a Business plan ($49) on June 15. and downgrade to a Small Business plan ($29) on July 1, you would be charged $49 on June 15, and $29 on July 15. You commit to either a month or a year in advance. When downgrading to a lower plan, you will stay on the current plan until your subscription is renewed. When that happens, you are charged the price of the lower plan.

**Example 3: Update your credit card**

A new credit card can be inputted at any time during your subscription. The payment provider will automatically charge the new credit card on the next payment.

**Example 4: Purchase a top-up**

If you need additional messages but don't want to upgrade to a larger plan permanently, you can purchase a top-up. The purchase is made on the credit card already configured on the subscription. If you want to buy the top-up on a different credit card, you will need to use the *Update credit card* feature first. The price of the top-up is always $19, and you can purchase as many top-ups as you want.

**Example 5: Purchase a subscription from Denmark**

We are based in Denmark why selling services to another Danish company are required to include 25% VAT (moms). The price on the various dialogs will automatically show the price including VAT as well as the VAT amount. Your invoices will include the amount in VAT to inform SKAT.
