# Using the elmah.io extension for Visual StudioBeing able to focus on .NET developers makes it possible to do all kinds of cool things. Like building an elmah.io extension for Visual Studio. That's exactly what we've done and here's how to use it.## Installation[Download the elmah.io extension](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/369827de-80ca-4b36-9b73-88bd85fdbc81) from the Visual Studio gallery.> Don't use the Extensions and Updates feature inside Visual Studio, since Visual Studio 2015 causes a problem with installing extensions in previous versions.Double click the downloaded VSIX and enable elmah.io in the versions of Visual Studio of your choice. The extension supports Visual Studio 2012, 2013 and 2015.## UsageInside Visual Studio navigate to View | Other Windows | elmah.io or simply search for elmah.io in the Quick Launcher (Ctrl+Q).You'll see the elmah.io window somewhere:![elmah.io windows in Visual Studio](/images/elmah_io_vs1.png)Click the sign in button in the top left corner.
