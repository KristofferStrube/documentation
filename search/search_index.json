Whether it's a nice looking SemVer string or a simple timestamp, being able to distinguish one version from the other is important. elmah.io supports sending version information from your application in every message logged in two ways: By adding the version manually (as explained in this document). By using the Deployment Tracking feature (as explained in Set Up Deployment Tracking ). Version Numbers on the UI Let's start by looking at how version numbers are represented in the elmah.io UI. Every message contains a version property as illustrated below: The error is logged by an application with version number 1.0.0. Looking at another error, the version number may look different: This way, you will be able to see which version of your software that logged each message. Having the version number on the message, opens up some interesting search possibilities. Imagine that you want to search for every message logged by 1.0.* versions of your software, including release candidates, etc. Simply do a search in the search box like this: The example above finds every message logged from 1.0.0, 1.0.0-rc1, 1.0.1, etc. Adding Version Numbers How you choose to represent version numbers in your system is really up to you. elmah.io doesn't require SemVer, even though we strongly recommend you to use it. Version is a simple string in our API , which means that you can send anything from SemVer to a stringified timestamp. Adding a version number to every message logged in elmah.io, is easy as 1-2-3. If you're using our API, there's a property named version where you can put the version of your application. Chances are that you are using one of the integrations like ELMAH, log4net or Serilog. In fact, there's multiple ways to send a version number to elmah.io. Globally using ELMAH You probably want to attach the same version number on every message logged in elmah.io. The easiest way to achieve that, is to create a global event handler for the OnMessage event, which is triggered every time the elmah.io client logs a message to elmah.io: Elmah.ErrorLog.GetDefault(null); // Forces creation of logger client var logger = ErrorLog.Client; logger.OnMessage += (sender, args) => { args.Message.Version = \"1.2.3\"; // Requires elmah.io.core version >= 2.0.26 } In the example, the message send off to elmah.io is decorated with the version number 1.2.3 You will need to replace this with the value of an app setting, the assembly info or whatever strategy you've used to make the version number available to your code. Try/catch using ELMAH If you're logging errors to elmah.io in catch blocks, logging the version number can be done using a similar approach to the above: try { CallSomeBusinessLogic(inputValue); } catch (Exception e) { e.Data.Add(\"X-ELMAHIO-VERSION\", \"1.2.3\"); ErrorSignal.FromCurrentContext().Raise(e); } In this case, the code at this point doesn't know anything about elmah.io. Luckily, there's an alternative to the Version property, by putting a custom element in the Data dictionary on Exception. The exact name of the key must be X-ELMAHIO-VERSION for elmah.io to interpret this as the version number. Using log4net log4net supports the concept of customer properties in various ways. Since log4net properties are converted to custom properties in elmah.io, the easiest way to add a version number of every message logged through log4net, is by configuring a global property somewhere in your initialization code: log4net.GlobalContext.Properties[\"X-ELMAHIO-VERSION\"] = \"1.2.3\"; The property name is equal to the custom element we used in the last section. log4net supports custom properties in the context of a log call as well. To do that, put the X-ELMAHIO-VERSION property in the ThreadContext before logging to log4net: log4net.ThreadContext.Properties[\"X-ELMAHIO-VERSION\"] = \"1.2.3\"; log4net.Error(\"This is an error message\"); Using NLog In progress.

This document will show you how. Apps on elmah.io are basically a nice wrapper around the Business Rule Engine on elmah.io. Using business rules, users can execute various actions based on full-text and Lucene queries against logged messages. Ignore messages based on a specific user agent or call the Slack API when fatal messages are logged are just a few examples on the possibilities using rules. For this example, we'll create a small app posting requests to RequestBin on every error. Probably not the most usable app, but serves the example well. RequestBin works by creating a bin, which you can then create HTTP requests against. Each bin contains a unique ID, which we will use in a second. Creating manifest.json To start creating the app, create a new file named manifest.json : { \"variables\": [{ \"key\": \"bin\", \"name\": \"Bin\", \"description\": \"The Id of the bin to post to\", \"example\": \"1k5c4qb2\", \"type\": \"text\", \"required\": true }], \"rule\": { \"title\": \"Post a message to RequestBin on all messages\", \"query\": \"severity: Error\", \"then\": { \"type\": \"http\", \"url\": \"https://requestbin.fullcontact.com/$bin\", \"method\": \"post\", \"contentType\": \"application/json\", \"body\": \"{\\\"timestamp\\\": \\\"$time\\\", \\\"message\\\": \\\"$message\\\", \\\"severity\\\": \\\"$severity\\\"}\" } } } The manifest consists of two blocks: variables and rule . Variables serves as input for generating the UI when users add the app to their log on elmah.io. In variables you can ask the user for information needed in order to execute the rule like username and password, access tokens or as in this example, an id of a bin on RequestBin. For now, only text , choice and number variables are available, but we may extend this with other types like bool , ipaddress etc. The rule section tell elmah.io what this app should do. Specifying a rule is optional and makes sense when creating apps that listen for messages matching a query. The two important fields to notice here is query and then . These terms match 1:1 to the same terms in the business rules. query should contain either a full-text query string or a Lucene query. Every message logged, matching this query, triggers the then part of this app. For the simple app, we query messages based on severity . For a complete list of search fields, visit the Rules tab on your log settings. In the then section we tell elmah.io what to do with messages matching the query . In this case, we want it to create a new HTTP request on https://requestbin.fullcontact.com. Notice how the $bin variables from before is used as part of the URL. body contains examples on built-in variables like $message and $time . Built-in variables are documented on the Rules tab of the log settings as well. A final note about then . In this example we use the \"type\": \"http\" to allow elmah.io to make HTTP requests. Types corresponding to other actions available in the rule engine are available as well. These are ignore , hide and email . Creating a NuSpec Apps for elmah.io are distributed as NuGet packages.

I though ELMAH was free. Why do you suddenly charge? My ELMAH SQL Server configuration doesn't work. Why not? We totally understand the confusion. The purpose of this article is to give a bit of background of what the differences between ELMAH and elmah.io and why they share similar names. What is ELMAH? ELMAH is an error logging framework originally developed by Atif Aziz able to log all unhandled exceptions from .NET web applications. Errors can be logged to a variety of destinations through ELMAH\u2019s plugin model called error logs. Plugins for XML, SQL Server, MySQL, Elasticsearch and many more exists. ELMAH automatically collects a lot of information from the HTTP context when logging the error, giving you the possibility to inspect request parameters, cookies and much more for the failed request. Custom errors can be logged to ELMAH, by manually calling the error log. What is elmah.io? elmah.io is a cloud-based error management system originally developed on top of ELMAH (see history for details). Besides supporting ELMAH, elmah.io also integrates with popular logging frameworks like log4net , NLog , Serilog and web frameworks like ASP.NET Core . elmah.io offers a superior notification model to ELMAH, with integrations to mail, Slack, HipChat and many others. elmah.io also built a lot of features outside the scope of ELMAH, like a complete uptime monitoring system. Comparison Feature ELMAH elmah.io Error Logging \u2705 \u2705 Self-hosted \u2705 \u274c Cloud-hosted \u274c \u2705 Search \u274c \u2705 New error detection \u274c \u2705 Error grouping \u274c \u2705 Issue tracking \u274c \u2705 log4net / NLog / Serilog \u274c \u2705 Clientside error logging \u274c \u2705 Slack/Teams/HipChat/etc. \u274c \u2705 Deployment tracking \u274c \u2705 Uptime monitoring \u274c \u2705 Discount on popular software \u274c \u2705 History So, why name a service elmah.io, when only a minor part of a client integration uses ELMAH? When elmah.io was introduced back in 2013, the intention was to create a cloud-based error logger for ELMAH. We had some simple search and graphing possibilities, but the platform was meant as an alternative to host your own errors logs in SQL Server or similar. In time, elmah.io grew from being a hobby project to an actual company. During those years, we realized that the potential of the platform exceeded the possibilities with ELMAH in many ways. New features not available in ELMAH have been added constantly. A process that would have been nearly impossible with ELMAH's many storage integrations. Today, elmah.io is a full error management system for everything from console applications to web apps and serverless code hosted on Azure or AWS. We've built an entire uptime monitoring system, able to monitor not only if your website fails but also if it even responds to requests. Why not change the name to something else, you may be thinking? That is our wish as well. But changing your SaaS (software-as-a-service) company name isn't exactly easy. We have tried a couple of times, first time back in 2016. We tried to name the different major features of elmah.io to sea creatures (like Stingray).

ELMAH automatically collects a lot of information from the HTTP context when logging the error, giving you the possibility to inspect request parameters, cookies and much more for the failed request.

When elmah.io was introduced back in 2013, the intention was to create a cloud-based error logger for ELMAH. We had some simple search and graphing possibilities, but the platform was meant as an alternative to host your own errors logs in SQL Server or similar. In time, elmah.io grew from being a hobby project to an actual company. During those years, we realized that the potential of the platform exceeded the possibilities with ELMAH in many ways. New features not available in ELMAH have been added constantly. A process that would have been nearly impossible with ELMAH's many storage integrations. Today, elmah.io is a full error management system for everything from console applications to web apps and serverless code hosted on Azure or AWS. We've built an entire uptime monitoring system, able to monitor not only if your website fails but also if it even responds to requests. Why not change the name to something else, you may be thinking? That is our wish as well. But changing your SaaS (software-as-a-service) company name isn't exactly easy. We have tried a couple of times, first time back in 2016. We tried to name the different major features of elmah.io to sea creatures (like Stingray).

Every time you change something that requires a new or upcoming charge on your credit card, we reset your subscription.

Example 1: Switch to a higher plan If you purchased a Small Business ($29) on June 1 and want to upgrade to Business ($49) on June 15, we charge you ~ $35. You already paid $15 for half of June on the Small Business plan, why the remaining amount is deducted from the $49. Your next payment will be on July 15. Example 2: Switch to a lower plan If you purchased a Business plan ($49) on June 15. and downgrade to a Small Business plan ($29) on July 1, you would be charged $49 on June 15, and $29 on July 15. You commit to either a month or a year in advance. When downgrading to a lower plan, you will stay on the current plan until your subscription is renewed. When that happens, you are charged the price of the lower plan. Example 3: Update your credit card A new credit card can be inputted at any time during your subscription. The payment provider will automatically charge the new credit card on the next payment. Example 4: Purchase a top-up If you need additional messages but don't want to upgrade to a larger plan permanently, you can purchase a top-up.

Things like cookies, stack trace, server variables and much more are stored to ease debugging the error at a later point in time. Most error log implementations for ELMAH doesn't support custom variables. Luckily, this is not the case for the elmah.io client. Let\u2019s look at some code. You have two options of decorating your errors with custom variables. Use the Data dictionary on .NET\u2019s Exception type I talk to a lot of developers and not all of them know about the wonderful world of the Data dictionary. All exceptions in .NET contains a property named Data and of type IDictionary . The Data dictionary is intended for user-defined information about the exception. The elmah.io client iterates through key/values in this dictionary and ship it off to elmah.io\u2019s API . To log custom data using Data , just add a new key/value pair to the Data dictionary: try { CallSomeBusinessLogic(inputValue); } catch (Exception e) { e.Data.Add(\"InputValueWas\", inputValue); ErrorSignal.FromCurrentContext().Raise(e); } In the example I add a custom variable named InputValueWas with the value of the inputValue variable. This way I will be able to see which input value caused the exception. Use the OnMessage hook in the elmah.io client You may not use ELMAH\u2019s ErrorSignal feature, but rely on ELMAH to log uncaught exceptions only. In this scenario you probably don\u2019t have access to the thrown exception. The elmah.io client offers a hook for you to be able to execute code every time something is logged: Elmah.ErrorLog.GetDefault(null); // Forces creation of logger client var logger = ErrorLog.Client; logger.OnMessage += (sender, args) => { if (args.Message.Data == null) args.Message.Data = new List<Item>(); args.Message.Data.Add(new Item { Key = \"SomeOtherVariable\", Value = someVariable }); }; You may not have seen the Logger type of elmah.io before, but what\u2019s important to know right now is, that Logger is responsible for logging messages to the elmah.io API. Another new term here is Message. A message is the type encapsulating all of the information about the thrown exception. In the code example I subscribe a new event handler to the OnMessage event. This tells the elmah.io client to execute your event handler, before actually logging an exception to elmah.io. I use the event to add a custom variable to the Data dictionary of the message logged to elmah.io. Looking at your custom data Logging custom data doesn\u2019t really make anything easier, unless you have a place to show them. Luckily for you, we have thought about that and now offers a new tab on the error details: Like the content in the other tabs of the error details, you will be able to filter results by the variable key. Searching custom data Custom data is not searchable by default. Sometimes it makes sense, that errors can be searched from values logged as part of custom data. For now, this feature is supported through the use of variable naming, but we may extend this to a configuration option through the UI as well. To make a custom variable and its value searchable through the UI (as well as through the API), name the variable with the prefix X-ELMAHIO-SEARCH- . The variable will become searchable through the name added after the prefix. Example: Elmah.ErrorLog.GetDefault(null); var logger = ErrorLog.Client; logger.OnMessage += (sender, args) =>{ if (args.Message.Data == null) args.Message.Data = new List<Item>(); args.Message.Data.Add(new Item { Key = \"X-ELMAHIO-SEARCH-myVariable\", Value = \"Some funky value\" }); }; would make myVariable searchable using this query: data.myVariable:funky Observe how the X-ELMAHIO-SEARCH- prefix is replaced with the data. prefix when indexed in elmah.io.

Check out this video tutorial or keep reading for the text version: To start logging errors from your Azure web application, go to the Azure Portal and select the website you want to monitor. Click the Extensions tool: Click the Add button and select .NET elmah.io for Azure : Accept the terms and click the OK button. The elmah.io Site Extension is now added. Once added, restart the website for the new extension to load. Finally, you need to add your API key ( Where is my API key? ) and log ID ( Where is my log ID? ) to Application settings : Make sure to use the app setting names ELMAHIO_APIKEY and ELMAHIO_LOGID . Your Azure web application now logs all uncaught exceptions to elmah.io. Please notice that this only works for ASP.NET, MVC, Web API, and similar. ASP.NET Core websites should be installed locally and re-deployed. Also, the elmah.io Site Extensions supports .NET Full Framework 4.6 and newer.","title":"Logging to elmah.io from a running website on Azure"},{"location":"logging-to-elmah-io-from-a-running-website-on-azure/#troubleshooting","text":"ConfigurationErrorsException: Could not load file or assembly 'Elmah' or one of its dependencies.

For help setting up general .NET Core logging similar to log4net, check out Logging from Microsoft.Extensions.Logging . To log all warnings and errors from ASP.NET Core, install the following NuGet package: Install-Package Elmah.Io.AspNetCore Call AddElmahIo in the ConfigureServices -method in the Startup.cs file: public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) { services.AddElmahIo(o => { o.ApiKey = \"API_KEY\"; o.LogId = new Guid(\"LOG_ID\"); }); ... } Replace API_KEY with your API key ( Where is my API key? ) and LOG_ID ( Where is my log ID? ) with the log Id of the log you want to log to. Call UseElmahIo in the Configure -method in the Startup.cs file: public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env, ILoggerFactory fac) { ... app.UseElmahIo(); ... } Make sure to call the UseElmahIo -method after installation of other pieces of middleware handling exceptions (like UseDeveloperExceptionPage and UseExceptionHandler ), but before any calls to UseStaticFiles , UseMvc and similar. That's it. Every uncaught exception will be logged to elmah.io. Configuring API key and log ID in options If you have different environments (everyone have a least localhost and production), you should consider adding the API key and log ID in your appsettings.json file: { ... \"ElmahIo\": { \"ApiKey\": \"API_KEY\", \"LogId\": \"LOG_ID\" } } Configuring elmah.io is done by calling the Configure method instead of AddElmahIo : public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) { services.Configure<ElmahIoOptions>(Configuration.GetSection(\"ElmahIo\")); services.AddElmahIo(); } Notice that you still need to call AddElmahIo in order to correctly register middleware dependencies. Finally, call the UseElmahIo -method (as you would do with config in C# too): public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env) { ... app.UseElmahIo(); ... } You can still configure additional options on the ElmahIoOptions object: public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) { services.Configure<ElmahIoOptions>(Configuration.GetSection(\"ElmahIo\")); services.Configure<ElmahIoOptions>(o => { o.OnMessage = msg => { msg.Version = \"1.0.0\"; }; }); services.AddElmahIo(); } Logging exceptions manually While automatically logging all uncaught exceptions is definitely a nice feature, sometimes you may want to catch exceptions and log them manually. If you just want to log the exception details, without all of the contextual information about the HTTP context (cookies, server variables, etc.), we recommend you to look at our integration for Microsoft.Extensions.Logging . If the context is important for the error, you can utilize the Ship -methods available in Elmah.Io.AspNetCore : try { var i = 0; var result = 42/i; } catch (DivideByZeroException e) { e.Ship(HttpContext); } When catching an exception, you simply call the Ship extension method with the current HTTP context as parameter. Additional options Events elmah.io for ASP.NET Core supports a range of events for hooking into the process of logging messages. Events are registered as actions when installing the elmah.io middleware: services.AddElmahIo(o => { o.ApiKey = \"API_KEY\"; o.LogId = new Guid(\"LOG_ID\"); o.OnMessage = message => { message.Version = \"42\"; }; o.OnError = (message, exception) => { logger.LogError(1, exception, \"Error during log to elmah.io\"); }; }); The actions provide a mechanism for hooking into the log process. The action registered in the OnMessage property is called by elmah.io just before logging a new message to the API. Use this action to decorate/enrich your log messages with additional data, like a version number. The OnError action is called if communication with the elmah.io API failed. If this happens, you should log the message to a local log (through Microsoft.Extensions.Logging, Serilog or similar). Do not log to elmah.io in your OnError action, since that could cause an infinite loop in your code. While elmah.io supports ignore rules serverside, you may want to filter out errors without even hitting the elmah.io API. Using the OnFilter function on the options object, filtering is easy: services.AddElmahIo(o => { ... o.OnFilter = message => { return message.Type == \"System.NullReferenceException\"; }; }); The example above, ignores all messages of type System.NullReferenceException . Remove sensitive form data The OnMessage event can be used to filter sensitive form data as well. In the following example, we remove the server variable named Secret-Key from all messages, before sending them to elmah.io. services.AddElmahIo(options => { options.ApiKey = \"API_KEY\"; options.LogId = new Guid(\"LOG_ID\"); options.OnMessage = msg => { var item = msg.ServerVariables.FirstOrDefault(x => x.Key == \"Secret-Key\"); if (item != null) { msg.ServerVariables.Remove(item); } }; }); Formatting exceptions A default exception formatter is used to format any exceptions, before sending them off to the elmah.io API. To override the format of the details field in elmah.io, set a new IExceptionFormatter in the ExceptionFormatter property on the ElmahIoOptions object: services.AddElmahIo(o => { ... o.ExceptionFormatter = new DefaultExceptionFormatter(); } Besides the default exception formatted ( DefaultExceptionFormatter ), Elmah.Io.AspNetCore comes with a formatter called YellowScreenOfDeathExceptionFormatter . This formatter, outputs an exception and its inner exceptions as a list of exceptions, much like on the ASP.NET yellow screen of death. If you want, implementing your own exception formatter, requires you to implement a single method. Logging responses not throwing an exception As default, uncaught exceptions (500's) and 404's are logged automatically. Let's say you have a controller returning a Bad Request and want to log that as well. Since returning a 400 from a controller doesn't trigger an exception, you will need to configure this status code: services.AddElmahIo(o => { ... o.HandledStatusCodesToLog = new List<int> { 400 }; } Logging through a proxy Since ASP.NET Core no longer support proxy configuration through web.config , you can log to elmah.io by configuring a proxy manually: services.AddElmahIo(o => { ... o.WebProxy = new System.Net.WebProxy(\"localhost\", 8888); } In this example, the elmah.io client routes all traffic through http://localhost:8000 . Logging health check results ASP.NET Core 2.2 introduced a new feature named Health Checks. Health checks enable much more sofisticated uptime checks, by allowing you to verify not only uptime on your own website, but also on any dependency or precondition necessary for your website to work. For a general introduction to health checks, I recommend you to read ASP.NET Core 2.2 Health Checks Explained . Health checks have error reporting built-in. We provide a publisher in order to allow ASP.NET Core to ship health check errors directly to your log on elmah.io. Start by installing the Elmah.Io.AspNetCore.HealthChecks NuGet package: Install-Package Elmah.Io.AspNetCore.HealthChecks -IncludePrerelease Then configure the elmah.io publisher as part of initializing health checks: public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) { ... services .AddHealthChecks() .AddElmahIoPublisher(\"API_KEY\", new Guid(\"LOG_ID\")); ... }","title":"Logging from ASP.NET Core"},{"location":"logging-to-elmah-io-from-aspnet-core/#logging-to-elmahio-from-aspnet-core","text":"Logging to elmah.io from ASP.NET Core Configuring API key and log ID in options Logging exceptions manually Additional options Events Remove sensitive form data Formatting exceptions Logging responses not throwing an exception Logging through a proxy Logging health check results If you are looking to log all uncaught errors from ASP.NET Core, you've come to the right place.

When running on Azure or similar, you can overwrite apiKey and logId with application settings or environment variables as already thoroughly documented on Microsoft's documentation. Application name To set the application name on all errors, set the Application property during initialization: builder.Services.Configure<ElmahIoFunctionOptions>(o => { o.ApiKey = config[\"apiKey\"]; o.LogId = new Guid(config[\"logId\"]); o.Application = \"MyFunction\"; }); Message hooks Elmah.Io.Functions provide message hooks similar to the integrations with ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core. Decorating log messages To include additional information on log messages, you can use the OnMessage event when initializing ElmahIoFunctionOptions : builder.Services.Configure<ElmahIoFunctionOptions>(o => { o.ApiKey = config[\"apiKey\"]; o.LogId = new Guid(config[\"logId\"]); o.OnMessage = msg => { msg.Version = \"1.0.0\"; }; }); The example above includes a version number on all errors.

If your function method is declared as async, remember to change the return type to Task . Without it, the function host never invoke ElmahIoExceptionFilter . The filter also supports config variables: [ElmahIoExceptionFilter(\"%apiKey%\", \"%logId%\")] The variables above, would require you to add your API key and log ID to your settings.json : { \"Values\": { \"apiKey\": \"API_KEY\", \"logId\": \"LOG_ID\" } } Adding debug information to error messages When debugging error messages logged from functions, it may be a good help to add information about the context the failing function is executed in. Contextual information isn't available for exception filters, but you can add it by implementing the following class: public class DebuggingFilter : FunctionInvocationFilterAttribute { public override Task OnExecutingAsync(FunctionExecutingContext executingContext, CancellationToken cancellationToken) { executingContext.Properties.Add(\"message\", executingContext.Arguments.First().Value.ToString()); executingContext.Properties.Add(\"connection\", ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[\"connection\"]); return base.OnExecutingAsync(executingContext, cancellationToken); } } In the example, I add two properties ( message and connectiction ). This is an example only and you will need to add named values matching your setup. Properties added to FunctionExecutingContext are automatically picked up and logged to elmah.io.

Logging manually You may want to log errors manually or even log information messages from JavaScript. To do so, Elmahio is actually a logging framework too: var logger = new Elmahio({ apiKey: 'YOUR-API-KEY', logId: 'YOUR-LOG-ID' }); logger.verbose('This is verbose'); logger.verbose('This is verbose', new Error('A JavaScript error object')); logger.debug('This is debug'); logger.debug('This is debug', new Error('A JavaScript error object')); logger.information('This is information'); logger.information('This is information', new Error('A JavaScript error object')); logger.warning('This is warning'); logger.warning('This is warning', new Error('A JavaScript error object')); logger.error('This is error'); logger.error('This is error', new Error('A JavaScript error object')); logger.fatal('This is fatal'); logger.fatal('This is fatal', new Error('A JavaScript error object')); logger.log({ title: 'This is a custom log message', type: 'Of some type', severity: 'Error' }); The Error object used, should be a JavaScript Error object . As for the log -function, check out message reference . Manual logging only works when initializing the elmah.io logger from code.

The process is identical with other project types. Create a new MVC project and install the elmah.io appender: Install-Package elmah.io.log4net Add the following to your AssemblyInfo.cs file: [assembly: log4net.Config.XmlConfigurator(Watch = true)] Add the following config section to your web.config file: <section name=\"log4net\" type=\"log4net.Config.Log4NetConfigurationSectionHandler, log4net\" /> Finally, add the log4net configuration element to web.config: <log4net> <appender name=\"ElmahIoAppender\" type=\"elmah.io.log4net.ElmahIoAppender, elmah.io.log4net\"> <logId value=\"LOG_ID\" /> <apiKey value=\"API_KEY\" /> </appender> <root> <level value=\"Info\" /> <appender-ref ref=\"ElmahIoAppender\" /> </root> </log4net> That\u2019s it! log4net is now configured and log messages to elmah.io. Remember to replace API_KEY ( Where is my API key? ) and LOG_ID ( Where is my log ID? ) with your actual log Id. To start logging, write your usual log4net log statements: var log = log4net.LogManager.GetLogger(typeof(HomeController)); try { log.Info(\"Trying something\"); throw new ApplicationException(); } catch (ApplicationException ex) { log.Error(\"Error happening\", ex); } Context Properties log4net offers a feature called context properties. With context properties, you can log additional key/value pairs with every log message. The elmah.io appender for log4net, supports context properties as well. Context properties are handled like custom properties in the elmah.io UI. Let's utilize two different hooks in log4net, to add context properties to elmah.io: log4net.GlobalContext.Properties[\"ApplicationIdentifier\"] = \"MyCoolApp\"; log4net.ThreadContext.Properties[\"ThreadId\"] = Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId; log.Info(\"This is a message with custom properties\"); Basically, we set two custom properties on contextual classes provided by log4net. To read more about the choices in log4net, check out the log4net manual . When looking up the log message in elmah.io, we see the context properties in the Data tab. Besides the two custom variables that we set through GlobalContext and ThreadContext , we see a couple of build-in properties in log4net, both prefixed with log4net: . Override Properties In case you want to set one or more core properties on each elmah.io message logged, you will need to add a bit of log4net magic. Examples could be, setting the User property on all log messages or setting a version number in the Version property. In the following code, we set the currently logged in username on all log messages: Hierarchy hier = log4netassembly.LogManager.GetRepository() as Hierarchy; var elmahIoAppender = (ElmahIoAppender)(hier?.GetAppenders()) .FirstOrDefault(appender => appender.Name .Equals(\"ElmahIoAppender\", StringComparison.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase)); elmahIoAppender.ActivateOptions(); elmahIoAppender.Client.Messages.OnMessage += (sender, a) => { a.Message.User = Thread.CurrentPrincipal?.Identity?.Name; }; This rather ugly piece of code would go into an initalization block, depending on the project type. The code starts by getting the configured elmah.io appender (typically set up in web.config or log4net.config ). With the appender, you can access the underlying elmah.io client and subscribe to the OnMessage event. This let you trigger a small piece of code, just before sending log messages to elmah.io. In this case, we set the User property to the currently logged in user. Remember to call the ActiveOptions method, to make sure that the Client property is initialized. Elmah.Io.Log4Net provides a range of reserved property names, that can be used to fill in data in the correct fields on the elmah.io UI. Let's say you want to fill the User field without overriding the OnMessage event as illustrated above: var properties = new PropertiesDictionary(); properties[\"user\"] = \"Arnold Schwarzenegger\"; log.Logger.Log(new LoggingEvent(new LoggingEventData { Level = Level.Error, TimeStampUtc = DateTime.UtcNow, Properties = properties, Message = \"Hasta la vista, baby\", })); This will fill in the value Arnold Schwarzenegger in the User field, as well as add a key/value pair to the Data tab on elmah.io.

Let's utilize two different hooks in log4net, to add context properties to elmah.io: log4net.GlobalContext.Properties[\"ApplicationIdentifier\"] = \"MyCoolApp\"; log4net.ThreadContext.Properties[\"ThreadId\"] = Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId; log.Info(\"This is a message with custom properties\"); Basically, we set two custom properties on contextual classes provided by log4net.

With an active history on almost 10 years, the possibilities with NLog are many and it\u2019s easy to find documentation on how to use it. To start logging messages from NLog to elmah.io, you need to install the Elmah.Io.NLog NuGet package: Install-Package elmah.io.nlog Please don't use NLog 4.6.0 since that version contains a bug that causes the elmah.io target to not load correctly. 4.5.11 or 4.6.1 . To configure the elmah.io target, add the following configuration to your app.config/web.config/nlog.config depending on what kind of project you\u2019ve created: <extensions> <add assembly=\"Elmah.Io.NLog\"/> </extensions> <targets> <target name=\"elmahio\" type=\"elmah.io\" apiKey=\"API_KEY\" logId=\"LOG_ID\"/> </targets> <rules> <logger name=\"*\" minlevel=\"Info\" writeTo=\"elmahio\" /> </rules> Replace API_KEY with your API key ( Where is my API key? ) and LOG_ID with the ID of the log you want messages sent to ( Where is my log ID? ). In the example we specify the level minimum as Info. This tells NLog to log only information, warning, error and fatal messages. You may adjust this, but be aware that your elmah.io log may run full pretty fast, especially if you log thousands and thousands of trace and debug messages. Log messages to elmah.io, just as with every other target and NLog: log.Warn(\"This is a warning message\"); log.Error(new Exception(), \"This is an error message\"); Custom Properties NLog supports custom properties like most other logging frameworks. With custom properties, you can log additional key/value pairs with every log message. The elmah.io appender for NLog, supports custom properties as well. Properties are persisted alongside every log message in elmah.io and searchable if named correctly . To log custom properties with NLog and elmah.io, you need to use an overload of each logging-method that takes a LogEventInfo object as parameter: var infoMessage = new LogEventInfo(LogLevel.Info, \"\", \"This is an information message\"); infoMessage.Properties.Add(\"Some Property Key\", \"Some Property Value\"); log.Info(infoMessage); This saves the information message in elmah.io with a custom property with key Some Property Key and value Some Property Value . As of NLog 4.5, structured logging is supported as well. To log a property as part of the log message, use the new syntax as shown here: log.Warn(\"Property named {FirstName}\", \"Donald\"); In the example, NLog will log the message Property named \"Donald\" , but the key ( FirstName ) and value ( Donald ), will also be available in the Data tab inside elmah.io. Elmah.Io.NLog provides a range of reserved property names, that can be used to fill in data in the correct fields on the elmah.io UI. Let's say you want to fill the User field using structured logging only: log.Info(\"{Quote} from {User}\", \"Hasta la vista, baby\", \"Arnold Schwarzenegger\"); This will fill in the value Arnold Schwarzenegger in the User field, as well as add two key/value pairs ( Quote and User ) to the Data tab on elmah.io.

Specify API key and log ID in appSettings If you are already using elmah.io, you may have your API key and log ID in the appSettings element already. To use these settings from withing the NLog target configuration you can use an NLog layout formatter: <targets> <target name=\"elmahio\" type=\"elmah.io\" apiKey=\"${appsetting:item=apiKey}\" logId=\"${appsetting:item=logId}\"/> </targets> By using the layout ${appsetting:item=apiKey} you tell NLog that the value for this attribute is in an appSettings element named elmahKey : <appSettings> <add key=\"apiKey\" value=\"API_KEY\" /> <add key=\"logId\" value=\"LOG_ID\" /> </appSettings> The appSettings layout formatter only works when targeting .NET Full Framework and requires Elmah.Io.NLog version 3.3.x or above and NLog version 4.6.x or above. Setting application name The application field on elmah.io can be set globally through NLog config: <targets> <target name=\"elmahio\" xsi:type=\"elmahio:elmah.io\" apiKey=\"API_KEY\" logId=\"LOG_ID\" application=\"APP_NAME\" /> </targets> Replace APP_NAME with the application you want logged to elmah.io Configure the elmah.io target from code The elmah.io target can be configured from C# code if you prefer or need to access the built-in events (see more later). The following adds logging to elmah.io: var config = new LoggingConfiguration(); var elmahIoTarget = new ElmahIoTarget(); elmahIoTarget.Name = \"elmahio\"; elmahIoTarget.ApiKey = \"API_KEY\"; elmahIoTarget.LogId = \"LOG_ID\"; config.AddTarget(elmahIoTarget); config.AddRuleForAllLevels(elmahIoTarget); LogManager.Configuration = config; The example will log all log levels to elmah.io. For more information about how to configure individual log levels, check out the NLog documentation on GitHub . Message hooks Elmah.Io.NLog provide message hooks similar to the integrations with ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core.

To start logging messages from NLog to elmah.io, you need to install the Elmah.Io.NLog NuGet package: Install-Package elmah.io.nlog Please don't use NLog 4.6.0 since that version contains a bug that causes the elmah.io target to not load correctly. 4.5.11 or 4.6.1 . To configure the elmah.io target, add the following configuration to your app.config/web.config/nlog.config depending on what kind of project you\u2019ve created: <extensions> <add assembly=\"Elmah.Io.NLog\"/> </extensions> <targets> <target name=\"elmahio\" type=\"elmah.io\" apiKey=\"API_KEY\" logId=\"LOG_ID\"/> </targets> <rules> <logger name=\"*\" minlevel=\"Info\" writeTo=\"elmahio\" /> </rules> Replace API_KEY with your API key ( Where is my API key? ) and LOG_ID with the ID of the log you want messages sent to ( Where is my log ID? ). In the example we specify the level minimum as Info. This tells NLog to log only information, warning, error and fatal messages. You may adjust this, but be aware that your elmah.io log may run full pretty fast, especially if you log thousands and thousands of trace and debug messages.

Properties are persisted alongside every log message in elmah.io and searchable if named correctly . To log custom properties with NLog and elmah.io, you need to use an overload of each logging-method that takes a LogEventInfo object as parameter: var infoMessage = new LogEventInfo(LogLevel.Info, \"\", \"This is an information message\"); infoMessage.Properties.Add(\"Some Property Key\", \"Some Property Value\"); log.Info(infoMessage); This saves the information message in elmah.io with a custom property with key Some Property Key and value Some Property Value . As of NLog 4.5, structured logging is supported as well. To log a property as part of the log message, use the new syntax as shown here: log.Warn(\"Property named {FirstName}\", \"Donald\"); In the example, NLog will log the message Property named \"Donald\" , but the key ( FirstName ) and value ( Donald ), will also be available in the Data tab inside elmah.io.

Sinks are superior to appenders, because they threat errors as objects rather than strings, a perfect fit for elmah.io which itself is built on NoSQL. Serilog already comes with native support for elmah.io, which makes it easy to integrate with any application using Serilog. In this example we\u2019ll use a ASP.NET MVC project as an example.

First, we create a new LoggerConfiguration and tell it to write to elmah.io. The log object can be used to log errors and you should register this in your IoC container. In this case, we don\u2019t use IoC, that is why the log object is set as the public static Logger property, which makes it accessible from everywhere. To log log exceptions to elmah.io through Serilog, is the Log class provided by Serilog: try { // Do some stuff which may cause an exception } catch (Exception e) { Log.Error(e, \"The actual error message\"); } The Error method tells Serilog to log the error in the configured sinks, which in our case logs to elmah.io. Simple and beautiful. Logging custom properties Serilog support logging custom properties in three ways: As part of the log message, through enrichers and using LogContext . All three types of properties are implemented in the elmah.io sink as part of the Data dictionary to elmah.io. The following example shows how to log all three types of properties: var logger = new LoggerConfiguration() .Enrich.WithProperty(\"ApplicationIdentifier\", \"MyCoolApp\") .Enrich.FromLogContext() .WriteTo.ElmahIo(new ElmahIoSinkOptions(\"API_KEY\", new Guid(\"LOG_ID\"))) .CreateLogger(); using (LogContext.PushProperty(\"ThreadId\", Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId)) { logger.Error(\"This is a message with {Type} properties\", \"custom\"); } Beneath the Data tab on the logged message details, the ApplicationIdentifier , ThreadId and Type properties can be found. Serilog.Sinks.ElmahIo provides a range of reserved property names, that can be used to fill in data in the correct fields on the elmah.io UI. Let's say you want to fill the User field using structured logging only: logger.Information(\"{Quote} from {User}\", \"Hasta la vista, baby\", \"Arnold Schwarzenegger\"); This will fill in the value Arnold Schwarzenegger in the User field, as well as add two key/value pairs (Quote and User) to the Data tab on elmah.io.

Since the elmah.io sink also picks up encrichers specified with Serilog, this example could be implemented by enriching all log messages with a field named version . Handle errors To handle any errors happening while processing a log message, you can use the OnError event when initializing the elmah.io sink: Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration() .WriteTo.ElmahIo(new ElmahIoSinkOptions(\"API_KEY\", new Guid(\"LOG_ID\")) { OnError = (msg, ex) => { Console.Error.WriteLine(ex.Message); } }) .CreateLogger(); The example implements a callback if logging to elmah.io fails.

ASP.NET Core Serilog provides a package for ASP.NET Core, that routes log messages from inside core through Serilog. We recommend to use this package together with the elmah.io sink, in order to capture warnings and errors happening inside ASP.NET Core. To use this, install the following packages: Install-Package Serilog.AspNetCore -DependencyVersion Highest Install-Package Elmah.Io.Client Install-Package Serilog.Sinks.ElmahIo (We install the Elmah.Io.Client manually, to make sure we run on the most recent version) Configure Serilog as usual: Log.Logger = new LoggerConfiguration() ... .WriteTo.ElmahIo(\"API_KEY\", new Guid(\"LOG_ID\"), LogEventLevel.Warning) .CreateLogger(); Finally, call the UseSerilog -method: public static IWebHost BuildWebHost(string[] args) => WebHost .CreateDefaultBuilder(args) .UseStartup<Startup>() .UseSerilog() .Build(); Now, all warnings, errors and fatals happening inside ASP.NET Core are logged to elmah.io. Config using appsettings.json While Serilog provides a great fluent C# API, some prefer to configure Serilog using an appsettings.json file. To configure the elmah.io sink this way, you will need to install the Serilog.Settings.Configuration NuGet package. Then configure elmah.io in your appsettings.json file: { ... \"Serilog\":{ \"Using\":[ \"Serilog.Sinks.ElmahIo\" ], \"MinimumLevel\": \"Warning\", \"WriteTo\":[ { \"Name\": \"ElmahIo\", \"Args\":{ \"apiKey\": \"API_KEY\", \"logId\": \"LOG_ID\" } } ] } } Make sure to specify the apiKey and logId arguments with the first character in lowercase.

Query messages using full-text search Full-text search Search Filters Lucene Query Syntax Full-text search The easiest approach to start searching your log messages, is by inputting search terms in the Search field on elmah.io: We don't want to get into too much details on how full-text work in Elasticsearch.

Full-text search work on analyzed fields in Elasticsearch, which means that wildcards and other constructs are fully supported. Full-text queries work great. when you want to do a quick search for some keywords like part of an exception message or stacktrace. Remember that the entire log message is search, why a search for 500 would hit both log messages with status code 500 and the term 500 in the stacktrace. Search Filters Search filters are built exclusively for elmah.io. They are built on top of Lucene Query Syntax (which we'll discuss in a minute), but much easier to write. Search filters are available through either the Add filter button below the search field or using various links and icons on the elmah.io UI.

The query syntax is a query language similar to the WHERE part of a SQL statement. Unlike SQL, the query syntax supports both filters (similar to SQL) and full-text queries. Basically all Lucene queries are made up of strings containing one or more terms and operators: term AND term OR term While AND and OR pretty much speaks for itself, terms needs a bit of explanation. A term can be a single term or a phrase. We've already seen two single terms in the full-text search example.

With this integration in place, you will be able to see when you released and if some of your releases caused more errors than others. While most pages on elmah.io supports everything from verbose to fatal messages, the context on deployment tracking is around warnings and errors. To set up deployment tracking, you will need to tell elmah.io when you release, using our REST API or one of the integrations. Deployments are as default created on all of your logs, but this can be tweaked. More about this later. For a complete overview of the possibilities with deployment tracking, watch this video tutorial: Generate a new API key While you can use the same API key for everything, we recommend you to create an API key specific for deployment tracking. To do so, go to the organization settings page by clicking the gears icon next to the organization name on either the dashboard or in the left menu. Select the API Keys tabs and click Add API Key . Fill in a name of choice and enable the Deployments > Write permission only: Click the save button and copy the API key for later use. Tell elmah.io when you release When you create a release of your software either manually or with the help from a tool like Octopus, you need to tell elmah.io about it. The elmah.io REST API v3 , provides an endpoint named deployments , which you can call when creating releases. After calling the endpoint, all new messages to your logs, will automatically be decorated with the most recent version number. Manually using Swagger UI If you release your software manually, creating the new release manually is easy using Swagger UI. Swagger UI is a graphical client for calling a Swagger enabled endpoint (much like Postman). Navigate to https://api.elmah.io/swagger/ui/index , expand the Deployments node and click the POST request: To create the release, input your API key ( Where is my API key? ) in the top right corner and click the JSON beneath Model Schema . This copies the example JSON to the deployment parameter. A minimal deployment would look like the following, but adding more information makes the experience within elmah.io even better: { \"version\": \"1.42.7\" } The version string in the example conforms to SemVer, but the content can be anything. The date of the release is automatically added if not specified in the JSON body. Click the Try it out! button and the deployment is created. Using PowerShell If you release your software using a build or deployment server, creating the new release is easy using a bit of PowerShell. To request the deployments endpoint, write the following PowerShell script: $version = \"1.42.7\" $ProgressPreference = \"SilentlyContinue\" $url = 'https://api.elmah.io/v3/deployments?api_key=API_KEY' $body = @{ version = $version } [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = ` [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12, [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls11, [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri $url -Body $body (replace API_KEY with your API key found on your organization settings page) In the example, a simple version string is sent to the API and elmah.io will automatically put a timestamp on that. Overriding user information and description, makes the experience within the elmah.io UI better. Pulling release notes and the name and email of the deployer, is usually available through environment variables or similar, depending on the technology used for creating the deployment. Using Kudu Kudu is the engine behind Git deployments on Microsoft Azure. To create a new elmah.io deployment every time you deploy a new app service to Azure, add a new post deployment script by navigating your browser to https://yoursite.scm.azurewebsites.net where yoursite is the name of your Azure website. Click the Debug console and navigate to site\\deployments\\tools\\PostDeploymentActions (create it if it doesn't exist). To create the new PowerShell file, write the following in the prompt: touch CreateDeployment.ps1 With a post deployment script running inside Kudu, we have the possibility to extract some more information about the current deployment. A full deployment PowerShell script for Kudu, would look like this: $version = Get-Date -format u (Get-Content ..\\wwwroot\\web.config).replace('$version', $version) | Set-Content ..\\wwwroot\\web.config $ProgressPreference = \"SilentlyContinue\" $commit = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable(\"SCM_COMMIT_MESSAGE\"); $commitId = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable(\"SCM_COMMIT_ID\"); $httpHost = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable(\"HTTP_HOST\"); $deployUrl = \"https://$httpHost/api/deployments/$commitId\" $username = \"MY_USERNAME\" $password = \"MY_PASSWORD\" $base64AuthInfo = [Convert]::ToBase64String([Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetBytes((\"{0}:{1}\" -f $username,$password))) $deployInfo = Invoke-RestMethod -Method Get -Uri $deployUrl -Headers @{Authorization=(\"Basic {0}\" -f $base64AuthInfo)} $url = 'https://api.elmah.io/v3/deployments?api_key=API_KEY' $body = @{ version = $version description = $commit userName = $deployInfo.author userEmail = $deployInfo.author_email } [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = ` [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12, [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls11, [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri $url -Body $body (replace MY_USERNAME and MY_PASSWORD with your Azure deployment credentials and API_KEY with your elmah.io API key located on your organization settings page) The script generates a new version string from the current date and time. How you want your version string looking, is really up to you. To fetch additional information about the deployment, the Kudu deployments endpoint is requested with the current commit id. Finally, the script creates the deployment using the elmah.io REST API. Using Octopus Deploy Notifying elmah.io of a new deployment from Octopus Deploy, is supported through a custom step template. To install and configure the template, follow the steps below: Go to the elmah.io - Register Deployment step template on the Octopus Deploy Library. Click the Copy to clipboard button. Click Library in the header on your Octopus Deploy instance and go to the Step templates tab. Click the Import link and paste the step template copied from the Library. Then click Import . Go to the Process tab of your project on Octopus Deploy and click the Add step button. The elmah.io step template is available in the bottom of the list. When added to the process, select Octopus Server in Run on and input your API key found on your organization settings page. Optionally input a log ID, to support multiple services . And we're done. On every new deployment, Octopus Deploy will notify elmah.io Using Azure DevOps Releases If you are using Releases in Azure DevOps, you should use our extension to notify elmah.io about new deployments. To install and configure the extension, follow the simple steps below: Go to the elmah.io Deployment Tasks extension on the Visual Studio Marketplace and click Install (log in if not already). Select the account to install the extension into and click Confirm : Go to your Azure DevOps project and edit your Release definition. Click Add tasks and locate the elmah.io Deployment Notification task. Click Add . Copy your API key from your organization settings page and paste it into the API Key field. In most cases, you want to input the ID of the log new deployments belong to. As default, we use the release name on Azure DevOps as the version number string on elmah.io. If you require a custom naming scheme, change the value in the Version field. All default and custom release variables are available through PowerShell variables. Finally, click Save . That's it! Azure DevOps will now notify elmah.io every time the release definition is executed. Remember to input a specific log ID as well, if you want to support versioning different services . Using Azure DevOps Builds Notifying elmah.io about new deployments is possible as a build step in Azure DevOps, by adding a bit of PowerShell: Edit the build definition currently building your project(s). Click the Add task button and locate the PowerShell task. Click Add . Fill in the details as shown in the screenshot. ... and here's the code from the screenshot above: $ProgressPreference = \"SilentlyContinue\" $url = \"https://api.elmah.io/v3/deployments?api_key=API_KEY\" $body = @{ version = \"$env:BUILD_BUILDNUMBER\" description = \"$env:BUILD_SOURCEVERSIONMESSAGE\" userName = \"$env:BUILD_REQUESTEDFOR\" userEmail = \"$env:BUILD_REQUESTEDFOREMAIL\" logId = \"LOG_ID\" } [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = ` [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12, [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls11, [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri $url -Body $body Replace API_KEY with your API key ( Where is my API key? ) and LOG_ID ( Where is my log ID? ) with the id of the log representing the application deployed by this build configuration. Using Umbraco Cloud Umbraco Cloud uses Azure to host Umbraco websites, why supporting deployment tracking pretty much corresponds the steps specified in Using Kudu . Navigate to https://your-umbraco-site.scm.s1.umbraco.io where your-umbraco-site is the name of your Umbraco site. Click the Debug console link and navigate to site\\deployments\\tools\\PostDeploymentActions\\deploymenthooks (create it if it doesn't exist). Notice the folder deploymenthooks , which is required in order for your scripts to run on Umbraco Cloud. Unlike Kudu, Umbraco Cloud only executes cmd and bat files. Create a new cmd file: touch create-deployment.cmd with the following content: echo \"Creating elmah.io deployment\" cd %POST_DEPLOYMENT_ACTIONS_DIR% cd deploymenthooks powershell -command \". .\\create-deployment.ps1\" The script executes a PowerShell script, which we will create next: touch create-deployment.ps1 The content of the PowerShell script looks a lot like in Using Kudu , but with some minor tweaks to support Umbraco Cloud: $version = Get-Date -format u $ProgressPreference = \"SilentlyContinue\" $commitId = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable(\"SCM_COMMIT_ID\"); $deployUrl = \"https://your-umbraco-site.scm.s1.umbraco.io/api/deployments/$commitId\" $username = \"MY_USERNAME\" $password = \"MY_PASSWORD\" $logId = \"LOG_ID\" $base64AuthInfo = [Convert]::ToBase64String([Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetBytes((\"{0}:{1}\" -f $username,$password))) $deployInfo = Invoke-RestMethod -Method Get -Uri $deployUrl -Headers @{Authorization=(\"Basic {0}\" -f $base64AuthInfo)} $url = 'https://api.elmah.io/v3/deployments?api_key=API_KEY' $body = @{ version = $version description = $deployInfo.message userName = $deployInfo.author userEmail = $deployInfo.author_email logId = $logId } [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = ` [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12, [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls11, [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri $url -Body $body Replace your-umbraco-site with the name of your site, MY_USERNAME with your Umbraco Cloud username, MY_PASSWORD with your Umbraco Cloud password, LOG_ID with the id if the elmah.io log that should contain the deployments ( Where is my log ID? ) and finally API_KEY with your elmah.io API key, found and your organization settings page. There you go. When deploying changes to your Umbraco Cloud site, a new deployment is automatically created on elmah.io. Using Bitbucket Pipelines Pipelines uses scripts, embedded in YAML-files, to configure the different steps required to build and deploy software. To notify elmah.io as part of a build/deployment, the first you will need to do, is to add your API key as a secure environment variable. To do so, go to Settings | Pipelines | Environment variables and add a new variable: Where is my API key? Then add a new script to your build YAML-file after building and deploying your software: pipelines: default: - step: script: ... - curl -X POST -d \"{\\\"version\\\":\\\"$BITBUCKET_BUILD_NUMBER\\\"}\" -H \"Content-Type:application/json\" https://api.elmah.io/v3/deployments?api_key=$ELMAHIO_APIKEY The script uses curl to invoke the elmah.io Deployments endpoint with the API key ( $ELMAHIO_APIKEY ) and a version number ( $BITBUCKET_BUILD_NUMBER ). The posted JSON can be extended to support additional properties like changelog and the name of the person triggering the deployment. Check out the API documentation for details. Using Atlassian Bamboo Setting up elmah.io Deployment Tracking on Bamboo, is easy using a bit of PowerShell. Add a new Script Task and select Windows PowerShell in Interpreter . Select Inline in Script location and add the following PowerShell to Script body : $ProgressPreference = \"SilentlyContinue\" Write-Host $bamboo_buildNumber $url = \"https://api.elmah.io/v3/deployments?api_key=API_KEY\" $body = @{ version = $Env:bamboo_buildNumber logId = \"LOG_ID\" } [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = ` [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12, [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls11, [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri $url -Body $body Replace API_KEY and LOG_ID and everything is configured. The script uses the build number of the current build as version number ( $Env:bamboo_buildNumber ). If you prefer another scheme, Bamboo offers a range of variables . Decorate your messages with a version number As default, all messages are decorated with the most recent deployment version. If you want to override this behavior, check out Adding Version Information for details. Versioning Different Services Chances are that your software consists of multiple services released independently and with different version numbers. This is a common pattern when splitting up a software system in microservices. How you choose to split your elmah.io logs are entirely up to you, but we almost always recommend having a separate log for each service. When doing so, you only want deployment tracking to show the releases from the service you are currently looking at. The problem here is that deployments on elmah.io are shown on all logs as default. To make sure that only deployments related to the service you are looking at are shown, you need to decorate each deployment with the log ID where it belong. The deployments API support this through an optional logId property. If set, the new deployment is only shown on the specified log.","title":"Set up Deployment Tracking"},{"location":"setup-deployment-tracking/#set-up-deployment-tracking","text":"Set Up Deployment Tracking Generate a new API key Tell elmah.io when you release Manually using Swagger UI Using PowerShell Using Kudu Using Octopus Deploy Using Azure DevOps Releases Using Azure DevOps Builds Using Umbraco Cloud Using Bitbucket Pipelines Using Atlassian Bamboo Decorate your messages with a version number Versioning Different Services Deployment tracking creates an overview of the different versions of your software and show you how well each version performed.

We're sure that everyone understand the challenge here. With that said, we want to help you stay within your message limits. Luckily, there's a lot of ways to limit messages. This article contains a list of the most common tactics to staying below your message limit. Ignore Rules The easiest way to limit logged messages, is by ignoring some of them. Ignored messages do not count towards the message limit. Message rules can be configured through the Rules tab on the Log Settings view. Rules consist of a query and an action. The query can either be a full-text query or written using Lucene Query Syntax. To create a new ignore rule, input a query on the Rules tab: All new rules are created with an ignore action as default, why you don't need to click the Then link for this type of rules. The example above, ignore all messages with a status code of 404 . For more information about the possibilities with rules, check out Creating Rules to Perform Actions on Messages . Filters Filters are basically Ignore Rules in disguise. With Filters we have collected the most common ignore rules and made them available as a set of checkboxes. To ignore all message matching a specific filter, enable one of the checkboxes on the Filters tab on Log Settings: If your website is available for everyone to access, ignoring known crawlers, bots and spiders is a good idea in most cases. Filtering below warning can also be a good idea, unless you are using elmah.io to log all log severities from a logging framework like NLog or Serilog. If staying within the message limit is more important than getting the full picture of the errors generated by your website, there are a couple of filters that will help you with that. The Filter Known filter will make sure that only one instance of each error is logged. If you still want to log multiple instances but stop at some point, the Filter Burst filter will stop logging after 50 instances logged. Finally, you can set a limit on how many errors you want logged to a specific log each month, by inputting a number in the Filter Limit filter. Please notice that using any of these last three filters, will cause inconsistent results in different graphs and features (like the spike detection). They can solve the problem of logging too much, but it is a sign that you are logging more data than included in your plan. A perfectly valid solution is to purchase a larger plan, get your logging under control (maybe even fix some errors?) and then downgrade when you are ready. Ignore future messages like this Sometimes you may find yourself on the Search tab with a search result thinking: \"I don't really care about these messages\". By clicking the caret next to the query filters, an Ignore future messages like this option is revealed: Clicking this option automatically ignore any future messages matching your current search result. Disable logs Each log can be disabled from Log Settings: Disables logs are shown as semi transparent on the dashboard, to help you remember that you disabled a log. Client-side message filtering Most of our clients support client filtering. All of the filtering options described above, filters messages server-side. This means that your application still communicates with elmah.io's API and need to wait for that to answer (even fore ignored messages). Filtering client-side from ASP.NET, MVC, Web API and other frameworks built on top of ASP.NET, can be done using ELMAH's (the open source project) filtering feature. To filter message, create a method named ErrorLog_Filtering in the Global.asax.cs file: void ErrorLog_Filtering(object sender, ExceptionFilterEventArgs args) { var httpContext = args.Context as HttpContext; if (httpContext.Response.StatusCode == 404) { args.Dismiss(); } } If you're using ASP.NET Core, our client supports the OnFilter action: services.AddElmahIo(o => { ... o.OnFilter = message => { return message.StatusCode == 404; }; }); Monitor current usage We send you an email when you have used 90% of your limit and again when reaching the limit. Monitoring your usage is a good supplement to the emails, since you are able to react early on (by upgrading, ignoring errors or something else). There's a usage graph on the Organisation Settings view: By clicking the question mark next to the counter, you will be able to see which logs that are taking up space: Fix bugs Seeing the same error over and over again? Maybe the best idea is to fix it :) I mean, that's the whole purpose of elmah.io: to help you fix bugs. And remember, the less bugs you have, the cheaper elmah.io gets. The ultimate motivation! Purchase a top-up Sometimes, a spike in errors can be caused by unexpected events like a blackhat bot deciding to bombard your site with requests or a junior dev on your team accidentally enabling verbose logging. In these cases, purchasing a top-up may be a better solution than permanently upgrading your plan. Top-ups can be purchased from your subscription, when you reach 90% of your included messages. Top-ups are purchased in bundles of 25,000 messages, valid for the rest of the calendar month. Upgrading to the next plan If you constantly go over the limit, you have probably reached a point where you will need to upgrade to a larger plan. You can upgrade and downgrade at any time, why upgrading a few months (until you get errors under control) and then downgrade again, is perfectly fine.","title":"Tips and tricks to stay below your message limit"},{"location":"tips-and-tricks-to-stay-below-your-message-limit/#tips-and-tricks-to-stay-below-your-message-limit","text":"Tips and tricks to stay below your message limit Ignore Rules Filters Ignore future messages like this Disable logs Client-side message filtering Monitor current usage Fix bugs Purchase a top-up Upgrading to the next plan Each plan on elmah.io include a maximum number of messages per month.

With interface changes in the client, upgrading from 2.x to 3.x requires more than simply upgrading the NuGet package. This is a guide to upgrading the Elmah.Io package. If you are logging to elmah.io from ASP.NET Core, you are already using the 3.x client. Updating the NuGet package First, you need to upgrade the Elmah.Io NuGet package: Update-Package Elmah.Io This installs the latest 3.x client. After doing so, we recommend to update to the latest Elmah.Io.Client package as well (updating Elmah.Io already updated Elmah.Io.Client, but to the lowest possible version): Update-Package Elmah.Io.Client The elmah.io.core package is no longer needed and can be uninstalled: Uninstall-Package elmah.io.core Next, you will need to add your API key to your web.config .

In this article, we will present the possibilities using the API in a use case driven approach. For a details reference of the various endpoints, visit the API V3 documentation or the API V2 documentation . Security Security in V3 of our API is implemented using API keys ( Where is my API key? ). When creating a new organization, a default API key is automatically created: You can create new keys and revoke an existing key, if you suspect that the key has been compromised. The API key acts as a secret and should not be available to people outside your team/organization. All requests to the elmah.io API needs the API key as either a HTTP header or query string parameter named api_key like this: GET https://api.elmah.io/v3/messages/LOG_ID?api_key=MY_API_KEY API V2 doesn't require (or support) API keys, why someone could extract information from your log using the log ID only. The log ID is used to tell elmah.io which log to put a new error into, when logged from your application ( Where is my log ID? ). As long as V2 of our API is available, the log ID needs to be kept secret as well. Messages Creating messages Before doing anything, we will need some messages to play with. The Create Message endpoint does just that. To create a simple message, POST to: # API V3 POST https://api.elmah.io/v3/messages/LOG_ID # API V2 POST https://elmah.io/api/v2/messages?logid=LOG_ID with a JSON body: { \"title\": \"This is a test message\" } (replace LOG_ID with your log ID): The title field is the only required field on a message, but fields for specifying severity, timestamp etc. are there. For more information, check out the documentation . If everything where successful, the API returns a HTTP status code of 201 and a location to where to fetch the new message. If the endpoint fails, the response will contain a description of what went wrong. Forgetting to set Content-Length , Content-Type and similar, will result in an invalid request. Getting a message In the example above, the API returned the URL for getting the newly created message: # API V3 GET https://api.elmah.io/v3/messages/LOG_ID/81C7C282C9FDAEA3 # API V2 GET https://elmah.io/api/v2/messages?id=81C7C282C9FDAEA3&logid=LOG_ID By making a GET request to this URL, we get back the message details: { \"id\": \"99CDEA3D6A631F09\", \"title\": \"This is a test message\", \"dateTime\": \"2016-07-03T14:25:46.087857Z\", \"severity\": \"Information\" } As shown in the returned body, elmah.io automatically inserted some missing fields like a timestamp and a severity. If no severity is specified during creating, a message is threated as information. Searching messages For the demo, we have inserted a couple of additional messages, which leads us to the next endpoint: searching messages. The search endpoint shares the root path with the get message endpoint, but only take a log ID. The simplest possible configuration, queries the API for a list of the 15 most recent messages by calling: # API V3 GET https://api.elmah.io/v3/messages/LOG_ID # API V2 GET https://elmah.io/api/v2/messages?logid=LOG_ID The response body looks like this: { \"messages\": [ { \"id\": \"81C7C282C9FDAEA3\", \"title\": \"This is another test message\", \"dateTime\": \"2016-07-03T14:31:45.053851Z\", \"severity\": \"Information\" }, { \"id\": \"99CDEA3D6A631F09\", \"title\": \"This is a test message\", \"dateTime\": \"2016-07-03T14:25:46.087857Z\", \"severity\": \"Information\" }, ... ], \"total\": 42 } For simplicity, the response has been simplified by not showing all of the results. The important thing to notice here, is the list of messages and the total count. messages contain 15 messages, which is the default page size in the search endpoint. To increase the number of returned messages, set the pagesize parameter in the URL (max 100 messages per request). The total count tells you, if there are more messages matching your search. To select messages from the next page, use the pageindex parameter. Returning all messages may be fine, but being able to search by terms is even more fun. To search, use the query , from and to parameters as shown here: # API V3 GET https://api.elmah.io/v3/messages/LOG_ID?query=another # API V2 GET https://elmah.io/api/v2/messages?logid=LOG_ID?query=another Searching for another will return the following response: { \"messages\": [ { \"id\": \"81C7C282C9FDAEA3\", \"title\": \"This is another test message\", \"dateTime\": \"2016-07-03T14:25:46.087857Z\", \"severity\": \"Information\" } ], \"total\": 1 } Now only 81C7C282C9FDAEA3 shows up, since that message contains the text another in the title field. Like specifying the query parameter, you can limit the number of messages using the from , to and pagesize parameters. Deleting a message When fixing the bug causing an error logged at elmah.io, you may want to delete the error. Deleting a single error is as easy as fetching it. Create a DELETE request to the errors unique URL: # API V3 DELETE https://api.elmah.io/v3/messages/LOG_ID/81C7C282C9FDAEA3 # API V2 DELETE https://elmah.io/api/v2/messages?id=81C7C282C9FDAEA3&logid=LOG_ID When successfully deleted, the delete endpoint returns a HTTP status code of 200 . Deleting messages Deleting messages one by one can be tedious work. To delete multiple errors, you can utilize the Delete Messages endpoint by creating a DELETE request to: # API V3 DELETE https://api.elmah.io/v3/messages/LOG_ID # API V2 DELETE https://elmah.io/api/v2/messages?logid=LOG_ID The request must contain a body with at least a query: { \"query\": \"test\" } An option for deleting messages by date range is available as well. Check out the API documentation for details. Hiding a message Depending on your use case, you may want to hide a message, rather than deleting it. Hidden messages are not shown as default through neither the UI, nor the REST API. But you will be able to search for them by enabling the Hidden checkbox on the UI. To hide a message, use the _hide endpoints like this: # API V3 POST https://api.elmah.io/v3/messages/LOG_ID/99CDEA3D6A631F09/_hide # API V2 POST https://elmah.io/api/v2/messages/_hide?id=99CDEA3D6A631F09&logid=LOG_ID If successful, the endpoint returns a HTTP status code of 200 .","title":"Using the REST API"},{"location":"using-the-rest-api/#using-the-rest-api","text":"Using the REST API Security Messages Creating messages Getting a message Searching messages Deleting a message Deleting messages Hiding a message Under the hood, everything related to communicating with elmah.io happens through our REST API.

If no severity is specified during creating, a message is threated as information.","title":"Getting a message"},{"location":"using-the-rest-api/#searching-messages","text":"For the demo, we have inserted a couple of additional messages, which leads us to the next endpoint: searching messages. The search endpoint shares the root path with the get message endpoint, but only take a log ID. The simplest possible configuration, queries the API for a list of the 15 most recent messages by calling: # API V3 GET https://api.elmah.io/v3/messages/LOG_ID # API V2 GET https://elmah.io/api/v2/messages?logid=LOG_ID The response body looks like this: { \"messages\": [ { \"id\": \"81C7C282C9FDAEA3\", \"title\": \"This is another test message\", \"dateTime\": \"2016-07-03T14:31:45.053851Z\", \"severity\": \"Information\" }, { \"id\": \"99CDEA3D6A631F09\", \"title\": \"This is a test message\", \"dateTime\": \"2016-07-03T14:25:46.087857Z\", \"severity\": \"Information\" }, ... ], \"total\": 42 } For simplicity, the response has been simplified by not showing all of the results. The important thing to notice here, is the list of messages and the total count. messages contain 15 messages, which is the default page size in the search endpoint. To increase the number of returned messages, set the pagesize parameter in the URL (max 100 messages per request). The total count tells you, if there are more messages matching your search. To select messages from the next page, use the pageindex parameter. Returning all messages may be fine, but being able to search by terms is even more fun. To search, use the query , from and to parameters as shown here: # API V3 GET https://api.elmah.io/v3/messages/LOG_ID?query=another # API V2 GET https://elmah.io/api/v2/messages?logid=LOG_ID?query=another Searching for another will return the following response: { \"messages\": [ { \"id\": \"81C7C282C9FDAEA3\", \"title\": \"This is another test message\", \"dateTime\": \"2016-07-03T14:25:46.087857Z\", \"severity\": \"Information\" } ], \"total\": 1 } Now only 81C7C282C9FDAEA3 shows up, since that message contains the text another in the title field.
