To check it out, force an internal server error or similar, and visit /elmah.axd or the search area of your log at elmah.io.\n\n\nSome of you may use the BlogEngine.NET binaries or even installed it using a one-click installer. In this case you will need to add elmah.io manually. To do that, use a tool like NuGet Package Explorer to download the most recent versions of ELMAH and elmah.io. Copy Elmah.dll and Elmah.Io.dll to the bin directory of your BlogEngine.NET installation. Also modify your web.config to include the ELMAH config as shown in the config example. Last but not least, remember to add the elmah.io error logger configuration as a child node to the \nelmah\n element:\n\n\nerrorLog type=\nElmah.Io.ErrorLog, Elmah.Io\n LogId=\nLOG_ID\n /\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere LOG_ID is your log id, located on the settings page.\n\n\nTo wrap this up, you may have noticed that there\u2019s a \nNuGet package\n to bring ELMAH support into BlogEngine.NET. This package adds the ELMAH assembly and config as well as adds a nice BlogEngine.NET compliant URL for browsing errors. Feel free to use this package, but remember to add it after the elmah.io package. Also make sure to cleanup the dual error log configuration:\n\n\nelmah\n\n  \nsecurity allowRemoteAccess=\nfalse\n /\n\n  \nerrorLog type=\nElmah.Io.ErrorLog, Elmah.Io\n LogId=\nLOGID\n /\n\n  \nsecurity allowRemoteAccess=\ntrue\n /\n\n  \nerrorLog type=\nElmah.SqlServerCompactErrorLog, Elmah\n connectionStringName=\nelmah-sqlservercompact\n /\n\n\n/elmah",

Things like cookies, stack trace, server variables and much more are stored to ease debugging the error at a later point in time. Most error log implementations for ELMAH doesn't support custom variables. Luckily, this is not the case for the elmah.io client.\n\n\nLet\u2019s look at some code. You have two options of decorating your errors with custom variables.\n\n\nUse the \nData\n dictionary on .NET\u2019s Exception type\n\n\nI talk to a lot of developers and not all of them know about the wonderful world of the Data dictionary. All exceptions in .NET contains a property named \nData\n and of type \nIDictionary\n. The \nData\n dictionary is intended for user-defined information about the exception. The elmah.io client iterates through key/values in this dictionary and ship it off to \nelmah.io\u2019s API\n. To log custom data using \nData\n, just add a new key/value pair to the \nData\n dictionary:\n\n\ntry\n{\n    CallSomeBusinessLogic(inputValue);\n}\ncatch (Exception e)\n{\n    e.Data.Add(\nInputValueWas\n, inputValue);\n    ErrorSignal.FromCurrentContext().Raise(e);\n}\n\n\n\n\nIn the example I add a custom variable named \nInputValueWas\n with the value of the \ninputValue\n variable. This way I will be able to see which input value caused the exception.\n\n\nUse the \nOnMessage\n hook in the elmah.io client\n\n\nYou may not use ELMAH\u2019s ErrorSignal feature, but rely on ELMAH to log uncaught exceptions only. In this scenario you probably don\u2019t have access to the thrown exception. The elmah.io client offers a hook for you to be able to execute code every time something is logged:\n\n\nLogger.OnMessage += (sender, args) =\n\n{\n    if (args.Message.Data == null) args.Message.Data = new List\nItem\n();\n    args.Message.Data.Add(new Item { Key = \nSomeOtherVariable\n, Value = someVariable });\n};\n\n\n\n\nYou may not have seen the Logger type of elmah.io before, but what\u2019s important to know right now is, that Logger is responsible for logging messages to the elmah.io API. Another new term here is Message. A message is the type encapsulating all of the information about the thrown exception.\n\n\nIn the code example I subscribe a new event handler to the \nOnMessage\n event. This tells the elmah.io client to execute your event handler, before actually logging an exception to elmah.io. I use the event to add a custom variable to the \nData\n dictionary of the message logged to elmah.io.\n\n\nLooking at your custom variables\n\n\nLogging custom data doesn\u2019t really make anything easier, unless you have a place to show them. Luckily for you, we have thought about that and now offers a new tab on the error details:\n\n\n\n\nLike the content in the other tabs of the error details, you will be able to filter results by the variable key.",

            "text": "ELMAH stores a lot of contextual information when an error occur. Things like cookies, stack trace, server variables and much more are stored to ease debugging the error at a later point in time. Most error log implementations for ELMAH doesn't support custom variables. Luckily, this is not the case for the elmah.io client.  Let\u2019s look at some code. You have two options of decorating your errors with custom variables.  Use the  Data  dictionary on .NET\u2019s Exception type  I talk to a lot of developers and not all of them know about the wonderful world of the Data dictionary. All exceptions in .NET contains a property named  Data  and of type  IDictionary . The  Data  dictionary is intended for user-defined information about the exception. The elmah.io client iterates through key/values in this dictionary and ship it off to  elmah.io\u2019s API . To log custom data using  Data , just add a new key/value pair to the  Data  dictionary:  try\n{\n    CallSomeBusinessLogic(inputValue);\n}\ncatch (Exception e)\n{\n    e.Data.Add( InputValueWas , inputValue);\n    ErrorSignal.FromCurrentContext().Raise(e);\n}  In the example I add a custom variable named  InputValueWas  with the value of the  inputValue  variable. This way I will be able to see which input value caused the exception.  Use the  OnMessage  hook in the elmah.io client  You may not use ELMAH\u2019s ErrorSignal feature, but rely on ELMAH to log uncaught exceptions only. In this scenario you probably don\u2019t have access to the thrown exception. The elmah.io client offers a hook for you to be able to execute code every time something is logged:  Logger.OnMessage += (sender, args) = \n{\n    if (args.Message.Data == null) args.Message.Data = new List Item ();\n    args.Message.Data.Add(new Item { Key =  SomeOtherVariable , Value = someVariable });\n};  You may not have seen the Logger type of elmah.io before, but what\u2019s important to know right now is, that Logger is responsible for logging messages to the elmah.io API. Another new term here is Message. A message is the type encapsulating all of the information about the thrown exception.  In the code example I subscribe a new event handler to the  OnMessage  event. This tells the elmah.io client to execute your event handler, before actually logging an exception to elmah.io. I use the event to add a custom variable to the  Data  dictionary of the message logged to elmah.io.  Looking at your custom variables  Logging custom data doesn\u2019t really make anything easier, unless you have a place to show them. Luckily for you, we have thought about that and now offers a new tab on the error details:   Like the content in the other tabs of the error details, you will be able to filter results by the variable key.",

            "text": "We bet that you use at least two environments for hosting you website: localhost and a production environment. You probably need to log website errors all your environments, but you don\u2019t want to mix errors from different environments in the same error log. Lucky for you, Microsoft provides a great way of differentiating configuration for different environments called Web Config transformation.  Start by creating two new logs at the elmah.io website called something like \u201cMy website\u201d and \u201cMy website development\u201d. The naming isn\u2019t really important, so pick something saying.  In your project install the elmah.io NuGet package:  Install-Package elmah.io  During the installation, NuGet will ask you for your elmah.io log id. In this dialog input the log id from the log named \u201cMy website development\u201d. The default configuration is used when running your website locally. When installed open the  web.release.config  file and add the following code:  elmah xdt:Transform= Replace \n   errorLog type= Elmah.Io.ErrorLog, Elmah.Io  LogId= INSERT_HERE  / \n   security allowRemoteAccess= false  /  /elmah   Replace the  INSERT_HERE  value with the log id named \u201cMy website\u201d. That\u2019s it! You can now build and deploy your website using different configurations. When nothing is changed, Visual Studio will build your website using the Debug configuration. This configuration looks for the ELMAH code in the  web.debug.config  file. We didn\u2019t add any ELMAH configuration to this file, why the default values from  web.config  are used. When selecting the Release configuration, Web. Config transformations will replace the default values in  web.config  with the new ELMAH configuration from  web.release.config .  To avoid spending numerous hours of debugging, remember that Web Config transformations are only run on deploy and not on build. In other words deploy your website using Visual Studio, MSBuild or third for the transformations to replace the right ELMAH config.",
