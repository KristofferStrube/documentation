Start by copying your Slack-token from the [API page](https://api.slack.com/web). We will need this when setting up the integration.![images/slack_authentication_page.png]On elmah.io, go to the Rules tab beneath your log settings. In this example we want a message on Slack every time a new error is logged in our elmah.io log. To do this, name your rule and input a query like illustrated on the following screenshot:![images/add_new_slack_rule.png]Hit the Then link and select HTTP request. Input the following values (remember to replace YOUR_TOKEN and YOUR_CHANNEL):| Method | POST || URL | https://slack.com/api/chat.postMessage?token=YOUR_TOKEN&channel=YOUR_CHANNEL&text=$message&username=elmah.io |The final result should look like this:![images/send_http_request_to_slack.png]Click the OK button and add the new rule by clicking Add. This configuration tells elmah.io, to make a HTTP request against the Slack API, every time a new error is logged. The message at elmah.io is shown as the chat message inside Slack:![images/elmah_io_error_on_slack.png]
